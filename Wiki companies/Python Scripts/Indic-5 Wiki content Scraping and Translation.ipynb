The prices of milk were arbitrarily determined at the time. The government had given Polson an effective monopoly in milk collection from Kaira and its subsequent supply to Mumbai.[12][13]\\nAngered by the unfair trade practices, the farmers of Kaira approached Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel under the leadership of local farmer leader Tribhuvandas K. Patel. He advised them to form a cooperative (Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers\\' Union) and supply milk directly to the Bombay Milk Scheme instead of Polson (who did the same but gave them low prices).[14] He sent Morarji Desai to organise the farmers. In 1946, the milk farmers of the area went on a strike which led to the setting up of the cooperative to collect and process milk.[13] Milk collection was decentralized, as most producers were marginal farmers who could deliver, at most, 1–2 liters of milk per day. Cooperatives were formed for each village, too.[15] By June 1948, the KDCMPUL had started pasteurising milk for the Bombay Milk Scheme. Then-Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri visited Anand to inaugurate Amul\\'s cattle feed factory. On 31 October 1964, and spent a night in village and spoke to farmers about their cooperative and after returning to Delhi he set in motion the creation of an organization, the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), to replicate the Kaira cooperative in other parts of India.[16] Under the selfless leadership of Tribhuvandas Patel, in 1973, Amul celebrated its 25th Anniversary with Morarji Desai, Maniben Patel and Verghese Kurien.[4]\\nUnder the leadership of Tribhuvandas Patel, the cooperative was further developed through the efforts of Dr. Verghese Kurien[4] and H. M. Dalaya. Dalaya\\'s innovation of making skim milk powder from buffalo milk was a technological breakthrough that revolutionized India\\'s organized dairy industry.[17]\\nWith Kurien\\'s help, the process was expanded on a commercial scale[4] which led to the first modern dairy of the cooperative at Anand. This cooperative would go on to compete against established players in the market.[18]\\nThe Amul plant at Anand, Gujarat showing the milk silos\\nThe trio\\'s (T. K. Patel, Kurien and Dalaya\\'s) success at the cooperative\\'s dairy soon spread to Anand\\'s neighborhood in Gujarat. Within a short span, five unions in other districts – Mehsana, Banaskantha, Baroda, Sabarkantha and Surat – were set up, following the approach sometimes described as the Anand pattern.[13]\\nIn 1970, it spearheaded the \"White Revolution\" of India. To combine forces and expand the market while saving on advertising and avoid competing against each other, the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd., an apex marketing body of these district cooperatives, was set up in 1973. The Kaira Union, which had the brand name Amul with it since 1955, transferred it to GCMMF.[19]\\nIn 1999, it was awarded the \"Best of all\" Rajiv Gandhi National Quality Award.[20]\\nTechnological developments at Amul have subsequently spread to other parts of India.\\nThe GCMMF is the largest food products marketing organisation in India. It is the apex organisation of the dairy cooperatives of Gujarat. It is the exclusive marketing organisation for products under the brand name of Amul and Sagar. Over the last five and a half decades, dairy cooperatives in Gujarat have created an economic network that links more than 3.1 million (3.1  million) village milk products with crores of consumers in India. In 2007, Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd., crossed US$ one Billion in its sales turnover and entered the elite club of food companies having this distinction from India.[21] In one more major achievement, the dairy cooperatives of Gujarat under the GCMMF fold crossed milk procurement of 10 million kgs. per day mark on 27 December 2007, which is the highest ever milk procurement achieved by any dairy network in India, be it private or cooperative and the entire quantity of milk received was accepted without any milk holidays and was processed successfully into milk and other milk products.[21]\\nOn 30 September 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated Amul\\'s chocolate plant in Mogar, Anand near their headquarters. The new plant has been built with an increased capacity of 1,000 tonnes per month against the earlier 250 tonnes a month capacity. GCMMF has invested around ₹3 billion for this project. It is a fully automated production factory with minimal human intervention.[22]',\n",

Bharti Telecom Limited (BTL) was incorporated and entered into a technical tie-up with Siemens AG of Germany for the manufacture of electronic push-button phones. By the early 1990s, Bharti was making fax machines, cordless phones and other telecom gear.[13] He named his first push-button phone as \\'Mitbrau\\'.\\nIn 1992, he successfully bid for one of the four mobile phone network licenses auctioned in India.[13] One of the conditions for the Delhi cellular licenses was that the bidder have some experience as a telecom operator. So, Mittal clinched a deal with the French telecom group Vivendi. He was one of the first Indian entrepreneurs to identify the mobile telecom business as a major growth area. His plans were finally approved by the Government in 1994[12] and he launched services in Delhi in 1995, when Bharti Cellular Limited (BCL) was formed to offer cellular services under the brand name AirTel. Within a few years, Bharti became the first telecom company to cross the 2 million mobile subscriber mark. Bharti also brought down the STD/ISD cellular rates in India under the brand name \\'India one\\'.[12]\\nIn 1999, Bharti Enterprises acquired control of JT Holdings, and extended cellular operations to Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.

However, both sides emphasize the tentative nature of the talks, while The Economist magazine noted, \"If anything, Bharti would be marrying up,\" as MTN has more subscribers, higher revenues and broader geographic coverage.[15] However, the talks fell apart as MTN Group tried to reverse the negotiations by making Bharti almost a subsidiary of the new company.[16] In May 2009, Bharti Airtel again confirmed that it was in talks with MTN and the companies agreed to discuss the potential transaction exclusively by 31 July 2009.

The route was inaugurated by the Viceroy, Lord Ripon, on 1 November 1880.[1] In 1882, steam locomotives were deployed experimentally to haul tram cars.[1]\\nA tram in 1945\\nIn 1900, the electrification of the tramway and conversion of its tracks to 4 ft 8\\n+\\n1⁄2 in (1,435 mm) (standard gauge) began.[1] The first electric tramcar in Calcutta ran from Esplanade to Kidderpore on 27 March 1902. In February 1943, the Calcutta and Howrah sections were connected by the new Howrah Bridge.[1]\\nIn 1951, the government of West Bengal entered an agreement with the Calcutta Tramways Company and the Calcutta Tramways Act of 1951 was enacted. The government assumed the tramways, reserving the right to purchase the system with two years' notice on 1 January 1972 or at any time thereafter.[1] In 1967, the Government of West Bengal passed the Calcutta Tramways Company (Taking Over of Management) Act and assumed management on 19 July. On 8 November 1976, the Calcutta Tramways (Acquisition of Undertaking) ordinance was promulgated under which the company (and its assets) was nationalised.[1]\\nThe Tramways system had degraded by the 1990s, and Minister for Transport Shyamal Chakraborty planned to close the network. In the meantime, Calcutta Tramways Company introduced bus service on 4 November 1992 with a fleet of 40 buses.[1] However, Melbourne tram conductor Roberto D'Andrea befriended fellow Calcutta conductors during a 1994 visit. When D'Andrea heard about the planned closure of tram network, he suggested an art project to decorate the trams (as was done in his home city). The project increased public awareness of the tram network and its value, ultimately saving it.[6]\",\n",

This changed in September 1956 when the Government of India established its own coal company National Coal Development Corporation (NCDC).[21] Collieries run by the Railways formed the nucleus of NCDC. This was to fulfill the fast growing energy requirements in the country to support rapid industrialization taking place through Five-Year Plans of the Government. In the same year, Singareni Colliery Company, which was operating in Andhra Pradesh since 1920, was also brought under the Government control when the Central Government and state Government of Andhra Pradesh acquired 45% and 55% shares respectively.\\nIn 1971, the Government of India nationalized all the 214 coking-coal mines and 12 coke-ovens running in the private sector, excluding those held by TISCO and IISCO for their captive use. On 1 January 1972, a new Government company Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) was formed to take control of these nationalized mines and coke-ovens. On 30 January 1973, all the remaining 711 non-coking coalmines of the country in private sector were also nationalized. 184 of these mines were handed over to BCCL, and remaining 527 were handed over to a newly opened department Coal Mines Authority. 4 months later, on 14 June 1973, this department was converted into a separate Government company CMAL. NCDC, earlier formed in 1957, was merged with CMAL, and 45% share-holding of Central Government in Singareni Collieries Company Ltd was also handed over to CMAL. CMAL started functioning with its 4 divisions, viz, Eastern Coalfields, Central Coalfields, Western Coalfields, and Central Mine Planning and Design Institute.\\nBy 1973, all coking coalmines were under BCCL, which was functioning as a subsidiary of Steel Authority of India (SAIL) under Department of Steel of the Ministry of Steel and Mines; and all non-coking coalmines were under CMAL, which was under Department of Mines of the Ministry of Steel and Mines. For better control, both BCCL and CMAL were brought on 11 October 1974 under the Department of Coal (now an independent Ministry) of the newly formed Ministry of Energy.\\nOn 1 November 1975, a new public-sector company Coal India Limited (CIL) was formed to enable better organizational and operational efficiency in coal sector. All the 4 Divisions of CMAL were given the company status, and were brought under CIL along with BCCL. 45% share-holding of the CMAL in Singareni Collieries Company was also transferred to CIL, and CMAL was closed.\\nThus, CIL started functioning in 1975 with 5 subsidiary companies under it. These were Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL), Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL), Central Coalfields Limited (CCL), Western Coalfields Limited (WCL), and Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Limited (CMPDIL).

The committee recommended the formation of a body similar to the Tennessee Valley Authority of the United States. Subsequently, W.L. Voorduin, a senior engineer of TVA, was appointed to study the problem. He suggested the multi-purpose development of the valley as a whole in 1944. Damodar Valley Corporation was set up in 1948 as “the first multipurpose river valley project of independent India.”[2]\\nDVC was formed with the central government and the governments of Bihar (later Jharkhand) and West Bengal participating in it. The main aims of the corporation were flood control, irrigation, generation and transmission of electricity, and year-round navigation.

However, in 1961 the shipyard was nationalised and renamed Hindustan Shipyard Limited (HSL).\\nIn 2010, HSL was transferred from the Ministry of Shipping to the Ministry of Defence.

Chanchal Singh (Jandiala, Jalandhar) were made in charge of the newspaper. Madan Mohan Malaviya and Tara Singh were among the members of the Managing Committee. The Managing Chairman and Chief Patron was Master Sunder Singh Lyallpuri.\\nAccording to Prem Shankar Jha who wrote an official history of the newspaper in 1999, most of the early funding of the paper, therefore, came from Sikhs in Canada. When financial troubles started in the early years, the Akalis approached two interested potential buyers from the nationalist movement. These were Motilal Nehru and Madan Mohan Malaviya, and ultimately Malviya bought the Hindustan Times. In fact, Malviya had to take out a loan of Rs. 40,000 with the help of Lala Lajpat Rai in order to finance the paper. In 1928, Gandhi chose a new editor, K.M Panikkar for the paper. By that time, the paper was running into financial troubles again and G. D. Birla underwrote some expenses and ultimately assumed ownership.[11]\\nDevdas Gandhi, son of Mahatma Gandhi, was inducted into the editors\\' panel, and was later appointed editor.[12] The opening ceremony was performed by Mahatma Gandhi on 26 September 1924. The first issue was published from Naya Bazar, Delhi (now Swami Sharda Nand Marg). It contained writings and articles from C. F. Andrews and Cattamanchi Ramalinga Reddy, among others.\\nK. M. Panikkar, also known as Sardar Panikkar, launched the Hindustan Times as a serious nationalist newspaper. As an Oxonian, historian and litterateur, Panikkar strived to make the paper broader than an Akali sheet. He became the editor and funds flowed freely from Akali patrons. He exerted himself strenuously, but the paper made very little headway. In two years, Panikkar could not take the print order any higher than 3,000. By then the Akali movement appeared to lose steam and funds dried up. The paper was saved from an untimely demise when Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya stepped in to realise his vision of a newspaper in Delhi.[13]\\nIt has its roots in the Indian independence movement of the first half of the twentieth century and even faced the noted \"Hindustan Times Contempt Case (August–November, 1941)\" at Allahabad High Court.[14] It was edited at times by many important people in India, including Devdas Gandhi, Sri Mulgaonkar, B.G. Verghese and Khushwant Singh. Sanjoy Narayan was editor in chief of the paper from 2008 to 2016.[15]',\n",

In 1851, the Solani Aqueduct Railway was built by Proby Cautley in Roorkee to transport construction materials for an aqueduct over the Solani River.[9] These railway tracks were dismantled after these projects were completed and no longer exist.\\nIndia's first passenger train, operated by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway and hauled by three steam locomotives (Sahib, Sindh and Sultan), ran for 34 kilometres (21 mi) with 400 people in 14 carriages on 1,676 mm (5 ft 6 in) broad gauge track between Bori Bunder (Mumbai) and Thane on 16 April 1853.[10][11] The Thane viaducts, India's first railway bridges, were built over the Thane creek when the Mumbai-Thane line was extended to Kalyan in May 1854.[12] Eastern India's first passenger train ran 39 km (24 mi) from Howrah, near Kolkata, to Hoogly on 15 August 1854.[1] The first passenger train in South India ran 97 km (60 mi) from Royapuram-Veyasarapady (Madras) to Wallajabad (Arcot) on 1 July 1856.[13]\\nOn 24 February 1873, a horse-drawn 3.8 km (2.4 mi) tram opened in Calcutta between Sealdah and Armenian Ghat Street.[14] On 9 May 1874, a horse-drawn tramway began operation in Bombay between Colaba and Parel.[15] In 1879, the Nizam's Guaranteed State Railway was established which built several railway lines across the then Hyderabad State with Kachiguda Railway Station serving as its headquarters.[16][17] In 1897, lighting in passenger coaches was introduced by many railway companies. On 3 February 1925, the first electric passenger train in India ran between Victoria Terminus and Kurla.[18]\\nThe organization of Indian railways into regional zones began in 1951,[19] when the Southern (14 April 1951), Central (5 November 1951), and Western (5 November 1951) zones were created.[20] Fans and lights were mandated for all compartments in all passenger classes in 1951, and sleeping accommodations were introduced in coaches. In 1956, the first fully air-conditioned train was introduced between Howrah and Delhi (Presently known as Poorva Express).[21] Ten years later, the first containerised freight service began between Mumbai and Ahmedabad. In 1974, Indian Railways endured a 20 day strike, which damaged the nation's economy.[22][23]\\nIn 1986, computerized ticketing and reservations were introduced in New Delhi.[24] In 1988, the first Shatabdi Express was introduced between New Delhi and Jhansi; it was later extended to Bhopal.[25] Two years later, the first self-printing ticket machine (SPTM) was introduced in New Delhi.[26] In 1993, air-conditioned three-tier coaches and a sleeper class (separate from second class) were introduced on IR. The CONCERT system of computerized reservations was deployed in New Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai in September 1996.

By this time, the airline had a fleet of twelve Boeing 737 aircraft, operating 83 daily flights to 23 domestic destinations.[17] In 1997, the Cabinet Committee on Foreign Investment (CCFI) of the Government of India announced that foreign airlines would no longer be permitted to take an equity stake in joint ventures with Indian aviation companies, reversing the Government's earlier policy which had allowed carriers such as Gulf Air, Kuwait Airways and Lufthansa to hold a maximum 40% equity stake in their joint ventures with Indian partners.[18] In October 1997, as per this directive, Naresh Goyal took back control of Trade Winds from its foreign investors.[19][7]\\nAt the Paris Air Show in June 1999, Jet Airways announced an order worth approximately $550 million for ten Boeing 737-800 aircraft.[16] The airline purchased its first Boeing 737-400 simulator from CAE Inc. in 2001.[20] By April 2001, the airline fleet had grown to 30 aircraft and was operating over 195 flights daily to 37 destinations within India.[21] Jet Airways suffered losses for the first time since its establishment in financial year 2001–2002 as demand fell and costs increased.[22] Jet Airways was announced as launch customer for the Embraer 175 at the Farnborough air show in 2002,[23] with an order for ten aircraft and ten options[24] worth $520 million. But the deal was postponed due to the airline's financial difficulties and eventually fell through.[25] In 2003, the Indian government decided to allow private carriers to operate international services to countries in south Asia, such as Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. [26] and Jet began preparations to launch international services.[27] The airline launched its first international flight in March 2004 from Chennai to Colombo.[28]\\nJet Airways was listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and became public company on 28 December 2004.[7] After the Government lifted the foreign ownership limits on Indian airlines to 49% from the previous 40%, the airline moved to raise funds via an IPO.[29] The company's IPO in February 2005, which offered 20% of the airline's stock, saw strong interest from investors leading to oversubscription in retail, non-institutional and institutional tranches[30] and raised Rs 18.9 billion, instantly making Naresh Goyal a paper billionaire.[31] Towards the end of 2004, the government had announced that privately owned scheduled carriers meeting certain criteria could operate to all countries apart from those in the Middle East.[32] Then in January 2005, the Ministry of Civil Aviation granted rights to Jet Airways to operate services to London Heathrow.[32] The airline started its first international, long-haul flight to London in May 2005[33] with two-class Airbus A340-300s sub-leased from South African Airways.[34]\",\n",

It had also planned to become the first private Indian carrier to serve China with flights to Guangzhou[6] from winter 2006, however, this did not materialize.

The company began as a representative of Danish manufacturers of dairy and allied equipment. However, with the start of the Second World War in 1939 and the resulting blockade of trade lines, the partners started a small workshop to undertake jobs and provide service facilities. Germany's invasion of Denmark in 1940 stopped supplies of Danish products. The war-time need to repair and refit and degauss ships offered L&T an opportunity, and led to the formation of a new company, Hilda Ltd, to handle these operations. L&T also started to repair and fabricate ships signalling the expansion of the company. The sudden internment of German engineers in British India (due to suspicions caused by the Second World War), who were to put up a soda ash plant for the Tata's, gave L&T a chance to enter the field of installation.[9]\\nIn 1944, ECC (Engineering Construction & Contracts) was incorporated by the partners; the company at this time was focused on construction projects (Presently, ECC is the construction division of L&T). L&T began several foreign collaborations. By 1945, the company represented British manufacturers of equipment used to manufacture products such as hydrogenated oils, biscuits, soaps and glass. In 1945, the company signed an agreement with Caterpillar Tractor Company, USA, for marketing earth moving equipment. At the end of the war, large numbers of war-surplus Caterpillar equipments were available at attractive prices, but the finances required were beyond the capacity of the partners. This prompted them to raise additional equity capital, and on 7 February 1946, Larsen & Toubro Private Limited was incorporated.[9]\\nAfter India's independence in 1947, the firm set up offices in Calcutta (now Kolkata), Madras (now Chennai) and New Delhi. In 1948, 55 acres of undeveloped marsh and jungle was acquired in Powai, Mumbai. In December 1950, L&T became a public company with a paid-up capital of ₹20 lakh (equivalent to ₹19 crore or US$2.5 million in 2020). The sales turnover in that year was ₹1.09 crore (equivalent to ₹102 crore or US$13 million in 2020). In 1956, a major part of the company's Mumbai office moved to ICI House in Ballard Estate, which would later be purchased by the company and renamed as L&T House, its present headquarters.[9]\\nDuring the 1960s, ventures included UTMAL (set up in 1960), Audco India Limited (1961), Eutectic Welding Alloys (1962) and TENGL (1963).[9]\\nIn 1965,the firm had been chosen as a partner for building nuclear reactors. Dr. Homi Bhabha, then chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) had in fact first approached L&T in the 1950s to fabricate critical components for atomic reactors. He convinced Holck-Larsen, a friend with whom he shared an interest in the arts that the company could do it, indeed must do it. L&T has since contributed significantly to the Indian nuclear programme ... Holck-Larsen was once asked by a junior engineer why L&T should get into building nuclear power plants when companies in the US and Germany were losing money on nuclear jobs.  He replied: 'Young man, India has to build nuclear power plants. If not L&T, who will do it?' [10]\\nDuring the 1970s, L&T was contracted to work with Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Its then chairman, Vikram Sarabhai, chose L&T as manufacturing partner. In 1972, when India launched its space programme, the firm was invited to participate.[11]\\nIn 1976, ECC bid for a large airport project in Abu Dhabi. ECC's balance sheet, however, did not meet the bid's financial qualification requirement. So it was merged into L&T. ECC was eventually rechristened L&T Construction and now accounts for the largest slice of the group's annual revenue.[12]\\nIn 1985, L&T entered into a partnership with Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). L&T was not yet allowed by the government to manufacture defence equipment but was permitted to participate in design and development programmes with DRDO. After the design and development was done,the firm had to hand over all the drawings to DRDO. The government would then assign the production work to a public sector defence unit or ordnance factory for manufacture. After a series of successes and positive policy initiatives, the firm today makes a range of weapon and missile systems, command and control systems, engineering systems and submarines through DRDO.[11]\",\n",

In 1952 the Royal Enfield Bullet was chosen as the most suitable bike for the job. In 1954, the government ordered 800 in units of the 350 cc model. In 1955, the Redditch company partnered with Madras Motors in India to form \\'Enfield India\\' to assemble, under licence, the 350 cc Royal Enfield Bullet motorcycle in Madras (now called Chennai). The tooling was sold to Enfield India so that they could manufacture components.[7] By 1962, all components were made in India. The Indian Enfield uses the 1960 engine (with metric bearing sizes), Royal Enfield still makes an essentially similar bike in the 350 cc and 500 cc models, along with several different models for different market segments.[8]\\nIn 1990, Royal Enfield collaborated with the Eicher Group, an automotive company in India, and merged with it in 1994.[9] Apart from bikes, Eicher Group is involved in the production and sales of commercial vehicles and automotive gears. Although Royal Enfield experienced difficulties in the 1990s, and ceased motorcycle production at their Jaipur factory in 2002,[10] by 2013 the company opened a new primary factory in the Chennai suburb of Oragadam on the strength of increased demand for its motorcycles. This was followed in 2017 by the inauguration of another new factory of a similar size to the facility at Oragadam (capacity 600,000 vehicles per year) at Vallam Vagadal. The original factory at Tiruvottiyur became secondary, and continues to produce some limited-run motorcycle models.[11][12][13][14]\\nFlooding, produced by the heaviest rainfall in Chennai in over a century, caused Royal Enfield to cut production by 4,000 motorcycles in November 2015, followed by a shutdown of the plants in Thiruvottiyur and Oragadam on 1 December, as well as the company offices in Chennai.[15] Production resumed at 50% capacity on 7 December and operations at both plants were back to normal on 14 December.[16]\\nRoyal Enfield announced its first takeover of another company in May, 2015 with the purchase of a UK motorcycle design and manufacturing firm, Harris Performance Products,[17][18] that had previously developed the chassis of the Royal Enfield Continental GT Cafe Racer.[19] Harris work with the UK-based part of Royal Enfield\\'s development team, who are based at the UK Technology Centre at Bruntingthorpe Proving Ground in Leicestershire.

The dealership will be Royal Enfield\\'s first company-owned store in the U.S., according to Rod Copes, president of Royal Enfield North America.[22][23] The company wants to establish about 100 dealerships in American cities starting with Milwaukee.\\nLater in August 2015, parent-business Eicher announced its entry in Indonesia as a part of its global strategy in the mid-sized (250–750 cc) motorcycle segment, initially starting retail operations from a dealership in Jakarta.[24][25] From April to September, 2015, Royal Enfield\\'s domestic sales were 50% higher than the previous year, despite a declining motorcycle market in India.[26]',\n",

       " ['After completing his undergraduate studies overseas, Sameer Mehra returned to India in 1998 with the idea of organic contract farming.[1][2] There was a growing global demand for organic produce and India had unique advantages that made it a natural choice for cultivating these products: tropical weather and varied landscape ensure agro-climatic diversity and a broad range of crops year-round. Due to the high costs as well as local traditions, fertilizers and pesticides have low penetration throughout much of India. With a US$23 billion global market for organic foods in 2002 alone and a huge shortage of supply, Mehra saw an opportunity to supply organic food from India.\\nIn 2003, Mehra founded Suminter India Organics. The company focused its product lines on non-perishable goods and organic cotton largely because spices, grains, and cotton were Indian specialties, and also because they required less intensive supply-chain management as compared to fresh produce. In order to meet global demand, Suminter integrated international organic certification into its operating model to create a \"farm to shelf\" fully integrated supply chain.\\nThough this added a 2–3 year gap between sourcing farms and organic procurement, Mehra eventually persuaded small-scale farmers of the long-term value of organic farming. Working with local NGOs, Suminter ensured consistent crop yields, safe farming practices, and a constant demand for produce. Moreover, the company passed on the benefit of higher organic margins, paying farmers a 10–20% premium over conventional products.[1][2]\\nSuminter has raised its first round of venture capital funding from Nexus India Capital in 2007.[4]\\nSuminter India Organics has been part of the Endeavor (non-profit) network since 2009.',\n",

Due to the erratic availability of power locally, and its rising costs, the highest business expenditure after the raw materials was electricity.[2] The cost of electricity also offset any profits made by the company.[3] After providing electricity for his own company, Tanti moved into wind energy production as a way to secure the textile company's energy needs, and founded Suzlon Energy.[4] Suzlon adopted a business model wherein clients would be responsible for 25% of the up-front capital investment and Suzlon would arrange the remaining 75% on loan. Initially, banks were hesitant to fund loans for this model, but by 2008, many Indian banks started financing wind power projects for Suzlon clients.[2]\\nIn 2001, Tanti sold off the textile business; Suzlon is still actively run by Tulsi Tanti, now in the role of Chairman, Suzlon Group. In 2003, Suzlon got its first order in USA from DanMar & Associates to supply 24 turbines in southwestern Minnesota.[5] Also in 2003 Suzlon set up an office in Beijing.[2]\\nSuzlon Rotor Corporation in 2006 began producing the blades in Pipestone, Minnesota in the United States. Among its clients is Wind Capital Group.[6]\\nIn the year 2006, Suzlon reached a definitive agreement for acquisition of Belgium firm Hansen Transmissions, specializing in gearboxes for wind turbines, for $565 million. In 2007, the company purchased a controlling stake in Germany's Senvion (then operating as REpower Systems) which valued the firm at US$1.6 billion.\\nIn June 2007, Suzlon had signed a contract with Edison Mission Energy (EME) of US for delivery of 150 wind turbines of 2.1 megawatts in 2008 and a similar volume to be delivered in 2009. EME had an option not to purchase the 150 turbines due to be delivered in 2009, which it has chosen to exercise.\\nIn November 2009, the company decided to sell 35% stake of Hansen for $370 million as part of its debt restructuring program, through placing new shares. It appointed Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley as the managers and book runners for the same.[7][8][9]\\nIn January 2011, Suzlon received an order worth US$1.28 billion for building 1000 megawatts of wind energy projects from the Indian branch of the Lord Swaraj Paul-owned Caparo Energy Ltd.[10]\\nIn May 2011, Suzlon announced returning to profitability after the financial crisis of 2009 [11]\\nIn October 2011, Suzlon sold its remaining 26.06% stake in Hansen Transmissions International NV to ZF Friedrichshafen AG for ₹8.9 billion (US$120 million). [12] In the same month, it also achieved full control of its German subsidiary REpower Systems (now Senvion) by acquiring the remaining 5% stake held by minority shareholders that resisted the takeover. The takeover was completed through the squeeze-out procedure by paying EUR 63 Million. [13]\\nIt has to redeem 500 million worth of FCCB's (foreign currency convertible bonds) in 2012 in tranches of 300 million in June and 200 million in October respectively. In line with the previously announced strategy to dispose of non-critical group assets to reduce long-term debt, Suzlon Chairman said that Suzlon Energy, will sell stake in its China manufacturing unit to China Power New Energy Development Company Limited for 3.4 billion rupees ($60 million).[14]\\nOn 30 November 2013 the Suzlon Group subsidiary REpower Systems (now Senvion SE) won an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract from Mitsui & Co (Australia) Ltd to deliver 52 wind turbines with a total rated output of 106.6 MW for the Bald Hills Wind Farm in Victoria, Australia.[15]\\nAs of August 2014, Suzlon's debt was over ₹ 8000 crores.[16] On 22 January 2015, Suzlon announced the sale of Senvion SE, its wholly owned subsidiary, to Centerbridge Partners, a private equity firm in a deal valued at ₹ 7200 crores.[17] The deal is expected to ease Suzlon's debt burden.[17] In a further equity infusion, Dilip Shanghvi Family and Associates (DSA), run by Dilip Shanghvi, the founder and managing directory of Sun Pharmaceutical, agreed to purchase a 23 percent stake in Suzlon for a sum of ₹1800 crores.[18] The deal will see Tanti's holding shrink to 24 percent, but management control will still remain with the Tanti family.[18] Its total borrowings stood at ₹11430.76 crore in FY16 from ₹17810.96 crore FY15.[19]\\nOn 17 January 2017, Suzlon Energy achieved 10,000 megawatts installed wind energy milestone in India. Suzlon's 10,000 MW of wind installation is capable of powering over 5 million households per annum and offsets approximately 21.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission annually which is equivalent to planting over 1500 million trees.[20]\\nAs on date, the company has fifteen manufacturing facilities and a workforce of over 8,000 employees globally.[21]\\nThe stock price is the company in the Indian stock exchanges gave but however recovered from the fall in 2009-2010[22]\\n\",\n",

Rangacharya, P. V. Rangacharya, D. Kesava Rao Pantulu and N. Subba Rao Pantulu, led by G. Subramania Iyer (a school teacher from Tanjore district) and M. Veeraraghavacharyar, a lecturer at Pachaiyappa\\'s College.[7] Started in order to support the campaign of Sir T. Muthuswamy Iyer for a judgeship at the Madras High Court and to counter the campaign against him carried out by the Anglo-Indian press, The Hindu was one of the newspapers of the period established to protest the policies of the British Raj. About 100 copies of the inaugural issue were printed at Srinidhi Press, Georgetown, on one rupee and twelve annas of borrowed money. Subramania Iyer became the first editor and Veera Raghavacharya, the first managing director of the newspaper.[citation needed]\\nThe paper was initially printed from Srinidhi Press but later moved to Scottish Press, then to The Hindu Press, Mylapore. Started as a weekly newspaper, the paper became a tri-weekly in 1883 and an evening daily in 1889. A single copy of the newspaper was priced at four annas. The offices moved to rented premises at 100 Mount Road on 3 December 1883. The newspaper started printing at its own press there, named \"The National Press,\" which was established on borrowed capital as public subscriptions were not forthcoming. The building itself became The Hindu\\'s in 1892, after the Maharaja of Vizianagaram, Pusapati Ananda Gajapati Raju, gave The National Press a loan both for the building and to carry out needed expansion.[citation needed]\\n\\'Its editorial stances have earned it the nickname, the \\'Maha Vishnu of Mount Road\\'.[8] \"From the new address, 100 Mount Road, which was to remain The Hindu\\'s home till 1939, there issued a quarto-size paper with a front-page full of advertisements—a practice that came to an end only in 1958 when it followed the lead of its idol, the pre-Thomson Times [London]—and three back pages also at the service of the advertiser. In between, there were more views than news.\"[9] After 1887, when the annual session of Indian National Congress was held in Madras, the paper\\'s coverage of national news increased significantly, and led to the paper becoming an evening daily starting 1 April 1889.[citation needed]\\nThe partnership between Veeraraghavachariar and Subramania Iyer was dissolved in October 1898. Iyer quit the paper and Veeraraghavachariar became the sole owner and appointed C. Karunakara Menon the editor. However, The Hindu\\'s adventurousness began to decline in the 1900s and so did its circulation, which was down to 800 copies when the sole proprietor decided to sell out. The purchaser was The Hindu\\'s Legal Adviser from 1895, S. Kasturi Ranga Iyengar,[10] a politically ambitious lawyer who had migrated from a Kumbakonam village to practise in Coimbatore and from thence to Madras.[citation needed] Iyengar\\'s son, Kasturi Srinivasan, became managing editor of The Hindu upon his father\\'s death in 1923 and Chief Editor in February 1934. The Kasturi family, descendants of Kasturi Ranga Iyengar, have since owned and, through most of the paper\\'s life, held the top editorial positions in the company.\\nJoint managing director N. Murali said in July 2003, \"It is true that our readers have been complaining that some of our reports are partial and lack objectivity. But it also depends on reader beliefs.\"[11] N. Ram was appointed on 27 June 2003 as its editor-in-chief with a mandate to \"improve the structures and other mechanisms to uphold and strengthen quality and objectivity in news reports and opinion pieces\", authorised to \"restructure the editorial framework and functions in line with the competitive environment\".[12] On 3 and 23 September 2003, the reader\\'s letters column carried responses from readers saying the editorial was biased.[13][14] An editorial in August 2003 observed that the newspaper was affected by the \\'editorialising as news reporting\\' virus, and expressed a determination to buck the trend, restore the professionally sound lines of demarcation, and strengthen objectivity and factuality in its coverage.[15]\\nIn 1987–88, The Hindu\\'s coverage of the Bofors arms deal scandal, a series of document-backed exclusives, set the terms of the national political discourse on this subject.[16] The Bofors scandal broke in April 1987 with Swedish Radio alleging that bribes had been paid to top Indian political leaders, officials and Army officers in return for the Swedish arms manufacturing company winning a hefty contract with the Government of India for the purchase of 155 mm howitzers. During a six-month period, the newspaper published scores of copies of original papers that documented the secret payments, amounting to $50 million, into Swiss bank accounts, the agreements behind the payments, communications relating to the payments and the crisis response, and other material. The investigation was led by a part-time correspondent of The Hindu, Chitra Subramaniam, reporting from Geneva, and was supported by Ram in Chennai. The scandal was a major embarrassment to the party in power at the centre, the Indian National Congress, and its leader Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. The paper\\'s editorial accused the Prime Minister of being party to massive fraud and cover-up.[17]\\nIn 1991, Deputy Editor N. Ravi, Ram\\'s younger brother, replaced G. Kasturi as editor. Nirmala Lakshman, Kasturi Srinivasan\\'s granddaughter and the first woman in the company to hold an editorial or managerial role, became Joint Editor of The Hindu and her sister, Malini Parthasarathy, Executive Editor.[18]\\nIn 2003, the Jayalalitha government of the state of Tamil Nadu, of which Chennai is the capital, filed cases against The Hindu for breach of privilege of the state legislative body. The move was perceived as a government\\'s assault on freedom of the press. The paper garnered support from the journalistic community.[19]\\nIn 2010, The Indian Express reported a dispute within the publisher of The Hindu regarding the retirement age of the person working as the editor-in-chief, a post which was then being served by N. Ram. Following this report, Ram decided to sue The Indian Express for defamation, a charge which the Indian Express denied. N. Ravi and Malini Parthasarathy voiced concern about Ram\\'s decision, saying that doing so goes against The Hindu’s values and that journalists shouldn’t fear “scrutiny”, respectively.[20] During subsequent events, Parthasarathy tweeted that “issues relating to management of newspaper have come to the surface, including editorial direction” in her response to a question. Later, Parthasarathy called N. Ram and other The Hindu employees “stalinists”, alleging that they were trying to oust her from the newspaper.[21][22]\\nIn 2011, during the resignation of N. Ram, the newspaper became the subject of a succession battle between the members of the Kasturi family. Ram had appointed Siddharth Varadarajan as his successor as the editor-in-chief of the newspaper who justified the appointment on the ostensible basis of separation of ownership and management, which was opposed by N. Ravi as it deviated from the publication\\'s tradition of family members retaining editorial control over it.[23] Varadarajan was subsequently accused by the dissident family members of being left leaning and the matter of Varadarajan\\'s appointment was brought in front of the board of directors of the parent company, Kasturi & Sons. During the dispute, Narasimhan Murali alleged that N. Ram ran The Hindu “like a banana republic, with cronyism and vested interests ruling the roost”. In the end the board voted 6–6 over a review of the appointment, the tie was broken by a deciding vote from Ram in his capacity as the chairman of the company and in favor of his decision.[21]\\nIn 2012, The Hindu became the only Indian newspaper to appoint a Readers Editor, an independent internal news ombudsman.[24]\\nOn 2 April 2013 The Hindu started \"The Hindu in School\" with S. Shivakumar as editor. This is a new edition for young readers, to be distributed through schools as part of The Hindu\\'s \"Newspaper in Education\" programme. It covers the day\\'s important news developments, features, sports, and regional news.[25] On 16 September 2013, The Hindu group launched its Tamil edition with K. Ashokan as editor.[26]\\nOn 21 October 2013, changes have been made in Editorial as well as business of The Hindu.[27] N. Ravi took over as Editor-in-chief of The Hindu and Malini Parthasarathy as Editor of The Hindu. As a consequence, Siddarth Varadarajan submitted his resignation. N. Ram has become Chairman of Kasturi & Sons Limited and Publisher of The Hindu and Group publications; and N. Murali, Co-chairman of the company.\\nDuring the 2015 South Indian floods, for the first time since its founding in 1878, the newspaper did not publish a print edition in Chennai market on 2 December, as workers were unable to reach the press building.[28]\\nOn 5 January 2016, Malini Parthasarathy, the Editor of the newspaper, resigned with immediate effect. It was reported by the media that she resigned her post, citing \"general dissatisfaction\" with her performance.[29][30] However, she continues to be a Wholetime Director of Kasturi & Sons Ltd.[30]\\nOn October 7, 2019, The Hindu announced that \"Two editorial meetings a month will be opened up to readers in order to expand conversations and build trust\", a first in India\\'s media industry.[31]\\nThe newspaper has foreign bureaus in eleven locations – Islamabad, Colombo, Dhaka, Kathmandu, Beijing, Moscow, Paris, Dubai, Washington, D.C., London, and most recently Addis Ababa.[32]\\nA 2014 article in the Indian Journal of Pharmacology praised The Hindu\\'s ongoing journalism and critique of clinical trials in India.[33]',\n",

       " [\"Main article: History of rail transport in India\\nThe first railway proposals for India were made in Madras in 1832.[9] The country's first transport train, Red Hill Railway (built by Arthur Cotton to transport granite for road-building), ran from Red Hills to the Chintadripet bridge in Madras in 1837.[9] In 1845, the Godavari Dam Construction Railway was built by Cotton at Dowleswaram in Rajahmundry, to supply stone for the construction of a dam over the Godavari River. In 1851, the Solani Aqueduct Railway was built by Proby Cautley in Roorkee to transport construction materials for an aqueduct over the Solani River.[9] These railway tracks were dismantled after these projects were completed and no longer exist.\\nIndia's first passenger train, operated by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway and hauled by three steam locomotives (Sahib, Sindh and Sultan), ran for 34 kilometres (21 mi) with 400 people in 14 carriages on 1,676 mm (5 ft 6 in) broad gauge track between Bori Bunder (Mumbai) and Thane on 16 April 1853.[10][11] The Thane viaducts, India's first railway bridges, were built over the Thane creek when the Mumbai-Thane line was extended to Kalyan in May 1854.[12] Eastern India's first passenger train ran 39 km (24 mi) from Howrah, near Kolkata, to Hoogly on 15 August 1854.[1] The first passenger train in South India ran 97 km (60 mi) from Royapuram-Veyasarapady (Madras) to Wallajabad (Arcot) on 1 July 1856.[13]\\nOn 24 February 1873, a horse-drawn 3.8 km (2.4 mi) tram opened in Calcutta between Sealdah and Armenian Ghat Street.[14] On 9 May 1874, a horse-drawn tramway began operation in Bombay between Colaba and Parel.[15] In 1879, the Nizam's Guaranteed State Railway was established which built several railway lines across the then Hyderabad State with Kachiguda Railway Station serving as its headquarters.[16][17] In 1897, lighting in passenger coaches was introduced by many railway companies. On 3 February 1925, the first electric passenger train in India ran between Victoria Terminus and Kurla.[18]\\nThe organization of Indian railways into regional zones began in 1951,[19] when the Southern (14 April 1951), Central (5 November 1951), and Western (5 November 1951) zones were created.[20] Fans and lights were mandated for all compartments in all passenger classes in 1951, and sleeping accommodations were introduced in coaches. In 1956, the first fully air-conditioned train was introduced between Howrah and Delhi (Presently known as Poorva Express).[21] Ten years later, the first containerised freight service began between Mumbai and Ahmedabad. In 1974, Indian Railways endured a 20 day strike, which damaged the nation's economy.[22][23]\\nIn 1986, computerized ticketing and reservations were introduced in New Delhi.[24] In 1988, the first Shatabdi Express was introduced between New Delhi and Jhansi; it was later extended to Bhopal.[25] Two years later, the first self-printing ticket machine (SPTM) was introduced in New Delhi.[26] In 1993, air-conditioned three-tier coaches and a sleeper class (separate from second class) were introduced on IR. The CONCERT system of computerized reservations was deployed in New Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai in September 1996. In 1998, coupon validating machines (CVMs) were introduced at Mumbai Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. The nationwide concierge system began operation on 18 April 1999. In February 2000, the Indian Railways website went online.[27] Individuals can book reserved tickets in online through Indian Railways Cattering and Tourism Corporation's(IRCTC) official website (www.irctc.co.in). On 3 August 2002, IR began online train reservations and ticketing.[28] The Railway Budget was usually presented two days before the Union budget every year till 2016. The central government approved merger of the Rail and General budgets from next year, ending a 92-year-old practice of a separate budget for the nation's largest transporter. On 31 March 2017, Indian Railways announced that the country's entire rail network would be electrified by 2022 or 2023, and become a net-zero (carbon emission) railway by 2030.[29][7]\\nOn 22 March 2020, Indian Railways announced a nationwide shutdown of passenger rail service to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in India. This became part of a nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.[30] The railway shutdown was initially scheduled to last from 23 to 31 March,[31] but the nationwide lockdown, as announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 24 March, was to last 21 days.[32] The national rail network is maintaining its freight operations during the lockdown, to transport essential goods.[33] On 29 March, Indian Railways announced that it would start service for special parcel trains to transport essential goods, in addition to regular freight service.[34] The national rail operator has also announced plans to convert coaches into isolation wards for patients of COVID-19.[35]\\nThe smaller railway viaduct near Thane in 1855\\nThe longer railway viaduct near Thane in 1855\\nRailway map of India in 1871\\nRailway map of India in 1909\",\n",

Watson, Sr., fired from the National Cash Register Company by John Henry Patterson, called on Flint and, in 1914, was offered a position at CTR.[13] Watson joined CTR as general manager then, 11 months later, was made President when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved.[14] Having learned Patterson\\'s pioneering business practices, Watson proceeded to put the stamp of NCR onto CTR\\'s companies.[15] He implemented sales conventions, \"generous sales incentives, a focus on customer service, an insistence on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen and had an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker\".[16][17] His favorite slogan, \"THINK\", became a mantra for each company\\'s employees.[16] During Watson\\'s first four years, revenues reached $9 million ($134 million today) and the company\\'s operations expanded to Europe, South America, Asia and Australia.[16] Watson never liked the clumsy hyphenated name \"Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company\" and on February 14, 1924, chose to replace it with the more expansive title \"International Business Machines\" which had previously been used as the name of CTR\\'s Canadian Division.[18] By 1933, most of the subsidiaries had been merged into one company, IBM.[19]\\nNACA researchers using an IBM type 704 electronic data processing machine in 1957\\nIBM has several leadership development and recognition programs to recognize employee potential and achievements. For early-career high potential employees, IBM sponsors leadership development programs by discipline (e.g., general management (GMLDP), human resources (HRLDP), finance (FLDP)). Each year, the company also selects 500 IBM employees for the IBM Corporate Service Corps (CSC),[20] which gives top employees a month to do humanitarian work abroad.[21] For certain interns, IBM also has a program called Extreme Blue that partners top business and technical students to develop high-value technology and compete to present their business case to the company\\'s CEO at internship\\'s end.[22]\\nThe company also has various designations for exceptional individual contributors such as Senior Technical Staff Member (STSM), Research Staff Member (RSM), Distinguished Engineer (DE), and Distinguished Designer (DD).[23] Prolific inventors can also achieve patent plateaus and earn the designation of Master Inventor. The company\\'s most prestigious designation is that of IBM Fellow. Since 1963, the company names a handful of Fellows each year based on technical achievement. Other programs recognize years of service such as the Quarter Century Club established in 1924, and sellers are eligible to join the Hundred Percent Club, composed of IBM salesmen who meet their quotas, convened in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Each year, the company also selects 1,000 IBM employees annually to award the Best of IBM Award, which includes an all-expenses-paid trip to the awards ceremony in an exotic location.\\nIBM\\'s culture has evolved significantly over its century of operations. In its early days, a dark (or gray) suit, white shirt, and a \"sincere\" tie constituted the public uniform for IBM employees.[24] During IBM\\'s management transformation in the 1990s, CEO Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. relaxed these codes, normalizing the dress and behavior of IBM employees.[25] The company\\'s culture has also given to different plays on the company\\'s acronym (IBM), with some saying it stands for \"I\\'ve Been Moved\" due to relocations and layoffs,[26] others saying it stands for \"I\\'m By Myself\" pursuant to a prevalent work-from-anywhere norm,[27] and others saying it stands for \"I\\'m Being Mentored\" due to the company\\'s open door policy and encouragement for mentoring at all levels.[28] In terms of labor relations, the company has traditionally resisted labor union organizing,[29] although unions represent some IBM workers outside the United States.[30] In Japan, IBM employees also have an American football team complete with pro stadium, cheerleaders and televised games, competing in the Japanese X-League as the \"Big Blue\".[31] IBM built the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, an electromechanical computer, during World War II. It offered its first commercial stored-program computer, the vacuum tube based IBM 701, in 1952. The IBM 305 RAMAC introduced the hard disk drive in 1956. The company switched to transistorized designs with the 7000 and 1400 series, beginning in 1958.\\nIn 1956, the company demonstrated the first practical example of artificial intelligence when Arthur L. Samuel of IBM\\'s Poughkeepsie, New York, laboratory programmed an IBM 704 not merely to play checkers but \"learn\" from its own experience. In 1957, the FORTRAN scientific programming language was developed. In 1961, IBM developed the SABRE reservation system for American Airlines and introduced the highly successful Selectric typewriter.\\nIn 1963, IBM employees and computers helped NASA track the orbital flights of the Mercury astronauts. A year later, it moved its corporate headquarters from New York City to Armonk, New York. The latter half of the 1960s saw IBM continue its support of space exploration, participating in the 1965 Gemini flights, 1966 Saturn flights, and 1969 lunar mission. IBM also developed and manufactured the Saturn V\\'s Instrument Unit and Apollo spacecraft guidance computers.\\nAn IBM System/360 in use at the University of Michigan c. 1969\\nIBM guidance computer hardware for the Saturn V Instrument Unit\\nOn April 7, 1964, IBM launched the first computer system family, the IBM System/360. It spanned the complete range of commercial and scientific applications from large to small, allowing companies for the first time to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their applications. It was followed by the IBM System/370 in 1970. Together the 360 and 370 made the IBM mainframe the dominant mainframe computer and the dominant computing platform in the industry throughout this period and into the early 1980s. They and the operating systems that ran on them such as OS/VS1 and MVS, and the middleware built on top of those such as the CICS transaction processing monitor, had a near-monopoly-level market share and became the thing IBM was most known for during this period.[32]\\nIn 1969, the United States of America alleged that IBM violated the Sherman Antitrust Act by monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the general-purpose electronic digital computer system market, specifically computers designed primarily for business, and subsequently alleged that IBM violated the antitrust laws in IBM\\'s actions directed against leasing companies and plug-compatible peripheral manufacturers. Shortly after, IBM unbundled its software and services in what many observers believed was a direct result of the lawsuit, creating a competitive market for software. In 1982 the Department of Justice dropped the case as \"without merit\".[33]\\nAlso in 1969, IBM engineer Forrest Parry invented the magnetic stripe card that would become ubiquitous for credit/debit/ATM cards, driver\\'s licenses, rapid transit cards, and a multitude of other identity and access control applications. IBM pioneered the manufacture of these cards, and for most of the 1970s, the data processing systems and software for such applications ran exclusively on IBM computers. In 1974, IBM engineer George J. Laurer developed the Universal Product Code.[34] IBM and the World Bank first introduced financial swaps to the public in 1981, when they entered into a swap agreement.[35] The IBM PC, originally designated IBM 5150, was introduced in 1981, and it soon became an industry standard. In 1991 IBM spun out its printer manufacturing into a new business called Lexmark.\\nIn 1993, IBM posted an $8 billion loss – at the time the biggest in American corporate history.[36] Lou Gerstner was hired as CEO from RJR Nabisco to turn the company around.[37] In 2002 IBM acquired PwC consulting.\\nIBM inventions: (clockwise from top-left) the hard-disk drive, DRAM, the UPC bar code, and the magnetic stripe card\\nIn 2005, the company sold its personal computer business to Chinese technology company Lenovo[38] and, in 2009, it acquired software company SPSS Inc. Later in 2009, IBM\\'s Blue Gene supercomputing program was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation by U.S. President Barack Obama. In 2011, IBM gained worldwide attention for its artificial intelligence program Watson, which was exhibited on Jeopardy! where it won against game-show champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. The company also celebrated its 100th anniversary in the same year on June 16. In 2012 IBM announced it has agreed to buy Kenexa and Texas Memory Systems,[39] and a year later it also acquired SoftLayer Technologies, a web hosting service, in a deal worth around $2 billion.[40] Also that year, the company designed a video surveillance system for Davao City.[41]\\nIn 2014, IBM announced it would sell its x86 server division to Lenovo for $2.1 billion.[42][better source needed] Also that year, IBM began announcing several major partnerships with other companies, including Apple Inc.,[43][44] Twitter,[45] Facebook,[46] Tencent,[47] Cisco,[48] UnderArmour,[49] Box,[50] Microsoft,[51] VMware,[52] CSC,[53] Macy\\'s,[54] Sesame Workshop,[55] the parent company of Sesame Street, and Salesforce.com.[56]\\nIn 2015, IBM announced three major acquisitions: Merge Healthcare for $1 billion,[57] data storage vendor Cleversafe, and all digital assets from The Weather Company, including Weather.com and the Weather Channel mobile app.[58][59] Also that year, IBM employees created the film A Boy and His Atom, which was the first molecule movie to tell a story. In 2016, IBM acquired video conferencing service Ustream and formed a new cloud video unit.[60][61] In April 2016, it posted a 14-year low in quarterly sales.[62] The following month, Groupon sued IBM accusing it of patent infringement, two months after IBM accused Groupon of patent infringement in a separate lawsuit.[63]\\nIn 2015, IBM bought the digital part of The Weather Company;,[64] Truven Health Analytics for $2.6 billion in 2016, and in October 2018, IBM announced its intention to acquire Red Hat for $34 billion,[65][66][67] which was completed on July 9, 2019.[68]\\nIBM announced in October 2020 that it would divest the Managed Infrastructure Services unit of its Global Technology Services division into a new public company.[69] The new company, Kyndryl, will have 90,000 employees, 4,600 clients in 115 countries, with a backlog of $60 billion.[70][71][72] IBM\\'s spin off will be greater than any of its previous divestitures, and welcomed by investors.[73][74][75] In January 2021, IBM appointed Martin Schroeter, who had been IBM\\'s CFO from 2014 through the end of 2017, as CEO of Kyndryl.[76][77]\\nIBM has regularly sold off low margin assets while shifting its focus to higher-value, more profitable markets. Examples include:\\n1991: Spun off its printer and keyboard manufacturing division, the IBM Information Products Corporation, to Lexmark\\n2002–2020: Acquired PwC Consulting (2002), SPSS (2009), The Weather Company (2016), Red Hat (2019), and European cloud consultant Nordcloud (2020)[78]\\n2005 and 2014, respectively: Sold its personal computer (ThinkPad/ThinkCentre) and x86-based server businesses to Lenovo\\n2015: IBM adopted a \"fabless\" model with semiconductors design, while offloading manufacturing to GlobalFoundries\\n2021: IBM spun-off its managed infrastructure services unit into a new public company named Kyndryl.[79][80] IBM also announced the acquisition of the enterprise software company Turbonomic for $1.5 Billion.[81]\\n2022: IBM announced that it would sell Watson Health to the private equity firm Francisco Partners.[82]',\n",

(HMTL), a joint venture between Hutchison Whampoa and the Max Group, was established on 21 February 1992.[4] The licence to operate in Mumbai (then Bombay) circle was awarded to Hutchison Max by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) in November 1994.[5] The cellular service branded \"Max Touch\" was launched the same year.[6] Hutchison Max entered into the Delhi telecom circle in December 1999, the Kolkata circle in July 2000 and the Gujarat circle in September 2000. Licences for these circles had initially been awarded by the DoT in 1994, 1997 and 1995 respectively. Between 1992 and 2006, Hutchison acquired interests in all 23 mobile telecom circles of India.[5]\\nHMTL was renamed Hutchison Essar Limited (HEL) in August 2005.[7] In Delhi, Uttar Pradesh (East), Rajasthan and Haryana, Essar Group was the major partner. But later Hutch took the majority stake. By the time of Hutchison Telecom\\'s initial public offering in 2004, Hutchison Whampoa had acquired interests in six mobile telecommunications operators providing service in 13 of India\\'s 23 licence areas and following the completion of the acquisition of BPL Mobile that number increased to 16. In 2006, it announced the acquisition of a company (Essar Spacetel — A subsidiary of Essar Group) that held licence applications for the seven remaining licence areas. Initially, the company grew its business in the largest wireless markets in India — in cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata. In these densely populated urban areas it was able to establish a robust network, well-known brand and large distribution network – all vital to long-term success in India. Then it also targeted business users and high-end post-paid customers which helped Hutchison Essar to consistently generate a higher Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) than its competitors. By adopting this focused growth plan, it was able to establish leading positions in India\\'s largest markets providing the resources to expand its footprint nationwide. In February 2007, Hutchison Telecom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with a subsidiary of Vodafone Group Plc to sell its 67% direct and indirect equity and loan interests in Hutchison Essar Limited for a total cash consideration (before costs, expenses and interests) of approximately $11.1 billion. The Acquisition was completed on May 8, 2007.[citation needed]\\nHutch was often praised for its award-winning advertisements which all follow a clean, minimalist look. A recurrent theme is that its message \"Hi\" stands out visibly though it uses only white letters on red background. Another successful ad campaign in 2003 featured a pug named Cheeka following a boy around in unlikely places, with the tagline, \"Wherever you go, our network follows.\" The simple yet powerful advertisement campaigns won it many admirers. Advertisements featuring the pug were continued by Vodafone even after rebranding. The brand subsequently introduced ZooZoos which gained even higher popularity than was created by the Pug. Vodafone\\'s creative agency is O&M while Harit Nagpal was the Marketing Director during the various phases of its brand evolution.[citation needed]',\n",

The company began as a representative of Danish manufacturers of dairy and allied equipment. However, with the start of the Second World War in 1939 and the resulting blockade of trade lines, the partners started a small workshop to undertake jobs and provide service facilities. Germany's invasion of Denmark in 1940 stopped supplies of Danish products. The war-time need to repair and refit and degauss ships offered L&T an opportunity, and led to the formation of a new company, Hilda Ltd, to handle these operations. L&T also started to repair and fabricate ships signalling the expansion of the company. The sudden internment of German engineers in British India (due to suspicions caused by the Second World War), who were to put up a soda ash plant for the Tata's, gave L&T a chance to enter the field of installation.[9]\\nIn 1944, ECC (Engineering Construction & Contracts) was incorporated by the partners; the company at this time was focused on construction projects (Presently, ECC is the construction division of L&T). L&T began several foreign collaborations. By 1945, the company represented British manufacturers of equipment used to manufacture products such as hydrogenated oils, biscuits, soaps and glass. In 1945, the company signed an agreement with Caterpillar Tractor Company, USA, for marketing earth moving equipment. At the end of the war, large numbers of war-surplus Caterpillar equipments were available at attractive prices, but the finances required were beyond the capacity of the partners. This prompted them to raise additional equity capital, and on 7 February 1946, Larsen & Toubro Private Limited was incorporated.[9]\\nAfter India's independence in 1947, the firm set up offices in Calcutta (now Kolkata), Madras (now Chennai) and New Delhi. In 1948, 55 acres of undeveloped marsh and jungle was acquired in Powai, Mumbai. In December 1950, L&T became a public company with a paid-up capital of ₹20 lakh (equivalent to ₹19 crore or US$2.5 million in 2020). The sales turnover in that year was ₹1.09 crore (equivalent to ₹102 crore or US$13 million in 2020). In 1956, a major part of the company's Mumbai office moved to ICI House in Ballard Estate, which would later be purchased by the company and renamed as L&T House, its present headquarters.[9]\\nDuring the 1960s, ventures included UTMAL (set up in 1960), Audco India Limited (1961), Eutectic Welding Alloys (1962) and TENGL (1963).[9]\\nIn 1965,the firm had been chosen as a partner for building nuclear reactors. Dr. Homi Bhabha, then chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) had in fact first approached L&T in the 1950s to fabricate critical components for atomic reactors. He convinced Holck-Larsen, a friend with whom he shared an interest in the arts that the company could do it, indeed must do it. L&T has since contributed significantly to the Indian nuclear programme ... Holck-Larsen was once asked by a junior engineer why L&T should get into building nuclear power plants when companies in the US and Germany were losing money on nuclear jobs.  He replied: 'Young man, India has to build nuclear power plants. If not L&T, who will do it?' [10]\\nDuring the 1970s, L&T was contracted to work with Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Its then chairman, Vikram Sarabhai, chose L&T as manufacturing partner. In 1972, when India launched its space programme, the firm was invited to participate.[11]\\nIn 1976, ECC bid for a large airport project in Abu Dhabi. ECC's balance sheet, however, did not meet the bid's financial qualification requirement. So it was merged into L&T. ECC was eventually rechristened L&T Construction and now accounts for the largest slice of the group's annual revenue.[12]\\nIn 1985, L&T entered into a partnership with Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). L&T was not yet allowed by the government to manufacture defence equipment but was permitted to participate in design and development programmes with DRDO. After the design and development was done,the firm had to hand over all the drawings to DRDO. The government would then assign the production work to a public sector defence unit or ordnance factory for manufacture. After a series of successes and positive policy initiatives, the firm today makes a range of weapon and missile systems, command and control systems, engineering systems and submarines through DRDO.[11]\",\n",

In the same year, the shares in Consolidated Coffee Estates Limited (CCE) were offered to the general public through a prospectus, with the parent, Edinburgh Company, being allotted a major share as a consideration for transfer of its estates.\\nShortly thereafter, during the early part of the 1950–1960 decade, the Edinburgh Company sold all its shareholdings to the Indian public, relinquishing its controlling interest in CCE and becoming one of the first sterling plantation company to become an Indian company. During 1966–67, Volkart properties in India, which included four estates, two curing works and an export division, merged with CCE, and the company was renamed as the erstwhile Consolidated Coffee Limited (CCL). Tata Tea Limited, in a trend setting and transparent open offer to the resident shareholders, acquired a controlling interest in CCL during 1991–1992.\\nCCL became the single largest coffee plantation company in Asia with its estates located in Kodagu, Hassan, and Chikmagalur districts of Karnataka.

Then employees and leaders of the Bank came forward to rescue the Bank. The owners were moved and had to change their decision of selling the bank and in turn, they decided to improve the position of the bank with the active cooperation and support of all the employees.

The prices of milk were arbitrarily determined at the time. The government had given Polson an effective monopoly in milk collection from Kaira and its subsequent supply to Mumbai.[12][13]\\nAngered by the unfair trade practices, the farmers of Kaira approached Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel under the leadership of local farmer leader Tribhuvandas K. Patel. He advised them to form a cooperative (Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers\\' Union) and supply milk directly to the Bombay Milk Scheme instead of Polson (who did the same but gave them low prices).[14] He sent Morarji Desai to organise the farmers. In 1946, the milk farmers of the area went on a strike which led to the setting up of the cooperative to collect and process milk.[13] Milk collection was decentralized, as most producers were marginal farmers who could deliver, at most, 1–2 liters of milk per day. Cooperatives were formed for each village, too.[15] By June 1948, the KDCMPUL had started pasteurising milk for the Bombay Milk Scheme. Then-Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri visited Anand to inaugurate Amul\\'s cattle feed factory. On 31 October 1964, and spent a night in village and spoke to farmers about their cooperative and after returning to Delhi he set in motion the creation of an organization, the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), to replicate the Kaira cooperative in other parts of India.[16] Under the selfless leadership of Tribhuvandas Patel, in 1973, Amul celebrated its 25th Anniversary with Morarji Desai, Maniben Patel and Verghese Kurien.[4]\\nUnder the leadership of Tribhuvandas Patel, the cooperative was further developed through the efforts of Dr. Verghese Kurien[4] and H. M. Dalaya. Dalaya\\'s innovation of making skim milk powder from buffalo milk was a technological breakthrough that revolutionized India\\'s organized dairy industry.[17]\\nWith Kurien\\'s help, the process was expanded on a commercial scale[4] which led to the first modern dairy of the cooperative at Anand. This cooperative would go on to compete against established players in the market.[18]\\nThe Amul plant at Anand, Gujarat showing the milk silos\\nThe trio\\'s (T. K. Patel, Kurien and Dalaya\\'s) success at the cooperative\\'s dairy soon spread to Anand\\'s neighborhood in Gujarat. Within a short span, five unions in other districts – Mehsana, Banaskantha, Baroda, Sabarkantha and Surat – were set up, following the approach sometimes described as the Anand pattern.[13]\\nIn 1970, it spearheaded the \"White Revolution\" of India. To combine forces and expand the market while saving on advertising and avoid competing against each other, the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd., an apex marketing body of these district cooperatives, was set up in 1973. The Kaira Union, which had the brand name Amul with it since 1955, transferred it to GCMMF.[19]\\nIn 1999, it was awarded the \"Best of all\" Rajiv Gandhi National Quality Award.[20]\\nTechnological developments at Amul have subsequently spread to other parts of India.\\nThe GCMMF is the largest food products marketing organisation in India. It is the apex organisation of the dairy cooperatives of Gujarat. It is the exclusive marketing organisation for products under the brand name of Amul and Sagar. Over the last five and a half decades, dairy cooperatives in Gujarat have created an economic network that links more than 3.1 million (3.1  million) village milk products with crores of consumers in India. In 2007, Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd., crossed US$ one Billion in its sales turnover and entered the elite club of food companies having this distinction from India.[21] In one more major achievement, the dairy cooperatives of Gujarat under the GCMMF fold crossed milk procurement of 10 million kgs. per day mark on 27 December 2007, which is the highest ever milk procurement achieved by any dairy network in India, be it private or cooperative and the entire quantity of milk received was accepted without any milk holidays and was processed successfully into milk and other milk products.[21]\\nOn 30 September 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated Amul\\'s chocolate plant in Mogar, Anand near their headquarters. The new plant has been built with an increased capacity of 1,000 tonnes per month against the earlier 250 tonnes a month capacity. GCMMF has invested around ₹3 billion for this project.

Bharti Telecom Limited (BTL) was incorporated and entered into a technical tie-up with Siemens AG of Germany for the manufacture of electronic push-button phones.

His plans were finally approved by the Government in 1994[12] and he launched services in Delhi in 1995, when Bharti Cellular Limited (BCL) was formed to offer cellular services under the brand name AirTel.

This was to fulfill the fast growing energy requirements in the country to support rapid industrialization taking place through Five-Year Plans of the Government. In the same year, Singareni Colliery Company, which was operating in Andhra Pradesh since 1920, was also brought under the Government control when the Central Government and state Government of Andhra Pradesh acquired 45% and 55% shares respectively.\\nIn 1971, the Government of India nationalized all the 214 coking-coal mines and 12 coke-ovens running in the private sector, excluding those held by TISCO and IISCO for their captive use. On 1 January 1972, a new Government company Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) was formed to take control of these nationalized mines and coke-ovens. On 30 January 1973, all the remaining 711 non-coking coalmines of the country in private sector were also nationalized. 184 of these mines were handed over to BCCL, and remaining 527 were handed over to a newly opened department Coal Mines Authority. 4 months later, on 14 June 1973, this department was converted into a separate Government company CMAL. NCDC, earlier formed in 1957, was merged with CMAL, and 45% share-holding of Central Government in Singareni Collieries Company Ltd was also handed over to CMAL. CMAL started functioning with its 4 divisions, viz, Eastern Coalfields, Central Coalfields, Western Coalfields, and Central Mine Planning and Design Institute.\\nBy 1973, all coking coalmines were under BCCL, which was functioning as a subsidiary of Steel Authority of India (SAIL) under Department of Steel of the Ministry of Steel and Mines; and all non-coking coalmines were under CMAL, which was under Department of Mines of the Ministry of Steel and Mines. For better control, both BCCL and CMAL were brought on 11 October 1974 under the Department of Coal (now an independent Ministry) of the newly formed Ministry of Energy.\\nOn 1 November 1975, a new public-sector company Coal India Limited (CIL) was formed to enable better organizational and operational efficiency in coal sector. All the 4 Divisions of CMAL were given the company status, and were brought under CIL along with BCCL. 45% share-holding of the CMAL in Singareni Collieries Company was also transferred to CIL, and CMAL was closed.\\nThus, CIL started functioning in 1975 with 5 subsidiary companies under it. These were Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL), Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL), Central Coalfields Limited (CCL), Western Coalfields Limited (WCL), and Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Limited (CMPDIL). In due course of time, 3 more companies were formed under CIL by carving out certain areas of CCL and WCL. These were Northern Coalfields Limited (NCL), South-Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL), and Mahanadi Coalfields Limited (MCL).\\nPursuant to the Fuel Policy of 1974, CIL also started the construction of India's First Low Temperature Carbonisation Plant at Dankuni in the late 1970s. It was renamed as Dankuni Coal Complex, and is one of the only operational Coal gas plant of this kind in the world.[22] Dankuni Coal Complex has been incurring heavy loss due to the Greater Calcutta Gas Supply Company (formerly known as Oriental Gas Co.) giving non-remunerative price and fixing them unilaterally. Coal India is planning to venture into Coal-to-Methanol technology at the existing Plant.\\nThe Government of India held 100% equity of CIL from 1975 till 2010.\",\n",

Given India's size (almost 3,000 kilometres (1,900 mi) from North to South and East to West), rail transport is often a cheaper option for all cargo over medium and long distances, especially if the cost of inter-modal transfers can be reduced. Seeing that containerised multi-modal door-to-door transport provided a solution to this problem, in 1966 Indian Railways entered the market for moving door-to-door domestic cargo in special DSO containers.\\nAlthough the first ISO container in India had been handled in Kochi as early as 1973, it was not until 1981 that the first ISO container was moved inland by Indian Railways to the country's first ICD at Bengaluru, also managed by the Indian Railways.\\nExpansion of the network to seven ICDs by 1988 saw an increase in container handling capacity, while along the way a strong view emerged that there was a need to set up a separate pro-active organisation to promote and manage the growth of containerisation in India.[4][5]\",\n",

The committee recommended the formation of a body similar to the Tennessee Valley Authority of the United States. Subsequently, W.L. Voorduin, a senior engineer of TVA, was appointed to study the problem. He suggested the multi-purpose development of the valley as a whole in 1944. Damodar Valley Corporation was set up in 1948 as “the first multipurpose river valley project of independent India.”[2]\\nDVC was formed with the central government and the governments of Bihar (later Jharkhand) and West Bengal participating in it. The main aims of the corporation were flood control, irrigation, generation and transmission of electricity, and year-round navigation. The corporation was also expected to provide indirect support for the over-all development of the region. However, while Voorduin had proposed the construction of eight dams, DVC built only four.[3]\\nMr. Voorduin\\'s \"Preliminary Memorandum\" suggested a multipurpose development plan designed for achieving flood control, irrigation, power generation and navigation in the Damodar Valley.

       " \"Main article: History of rail transport in India\\nThe first railway proposals for India were made in Madras in 1832.[9] The country's first transport train, Red Hill Railway (built by Arthur Cotton to transport granite for road-building), ran from Red Hills to the Chintadripet bridge in Madras in 1837.[9] In 1845, the Godavari Dam Construction Railway was built by Cotton at Dowleswaram in Rajahmundry, to supply stone for the construction of a dam over the Godavari River. In 1851, the Solani Aqueduct Railway was built by Proby Cautley in Roorkee to transport construction materials for an aqueduct over the Solani River.[9] These railway tracks were dismantled after these projects were completed and no longer exist.\\nIndia's first passenger train, operated by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway and hauled by three steam locomotives (Sahib, Sindh and Sultan), ran for 34 kilometres (21 mi) with 400 people in 14 carriages on 1,676 mm (5 ft 6 in) broad gauge track between Bori Bunder (Mumbai) and Thane on 16 April 1853.[10][11] The Thane viaducts, India's first railway bridges, were built over the Thane creek when the Mumbai-Thane line was extended to Kalyan in May 1854.[12] Eastern India's first passenger train ran 39 km (24 mi) from Howrah, near Kolkata, to Hoogly on 15 August 1854.[1] The first passenger train in South India ran 97 km (60 mi) from Royapuram-Veyasarapady (Madras) to Wallajabad (Arcot) on 1 July 1856.[13]\\nOn 24 February 1873, a horse-drawn 3.8 km (2.4 mi) tram opened in Calcutta between Sealdah and Armenian Ghat Street.[14] On 9 May 1874, a horse-drawn tramway began operation in Bombay between Colaba and Parel.[15] In 1879, the Nizam's Guaranteed State Railway was established which built several railway lines across the then Hyderabad State with Kachiguda Railway Station serving as its headquarters.[16][17] In 1897, lighting in passenger coaches was introduced by many railway companies. On 3 February 1925, the first electric passenger train in India ran between Victoria Terminus and Kurla.[18]\\nThe organization of Indian railways into regional zones began in 1951,[19] when the Southern (14 April 1951), Central (5 November 1951), and Western (5 November 1951) zones were created.[20] Fans and lights were mandated for all compartments in all passenger classes in 1951, and sleeping accommodations were introduced in coaches. In 1956, the first fully air-conditioned train was introduced between Howrah and Delhi (Presently known as Poorva Express).[21] Ten years later, the first containerised freight service began between Mumbai and Ahmedabad. In 1974, Indian Railways endured a 20 day strike, which damaged the nation's economy.[22][23]\\nIn 1986, computerized ticketing and reservations were introduced in New Delhi.[24] In 1988, the first Shatabdi Express was introduced between New Delhi and Jhansi; it was later extended to Bhopal.[25] Two years later, the first self-printing ticket machine (SPTM) was introduced in New Delhi.[26] In 1993, air-conditioned three-tier coaches and a sleeper class (separate from second class) were introduced on IR. The CONCERT system of computerized reservations was deployed in New Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai in September 1996. In 1998, coupon validating machines (CVMs) were introduced at Mumbai Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. The nationwide concierge system began operation on 18 April 1999. In February 2000, the Indian Railways website went online.[27] Individuals can book reserved tickets in online through Indian Railways Cattering and Tourism Corporation's(IRCTC) official website (www.irctc.co.in). On 3 August 2002, IR began online train reservations and ticketing.[28] The Railway Budget was usually presented two days before the Union budget every year till 2016. The central government approved merger of the Rail and General budgets from next year, ending a 92-year-old practice of a separate budget for the nation's largest transporter. On 31 March 2017, Indian Railways announced that the country's entire rail network would be electrified by 2022 or 2023, and become a net-zero (carbon emission) railway by 2030.[29][7]\\nOn 22 March 2020, Indian Railways announced a nationwide shutdown of passenger rail service to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in India. This became part of a nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.[30] The railway shutdown was initially scheduled to last from 23 to 31 March,[31] but the nationwide lockdown, as announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 24 March, was to last 21 days.[32] The national rail network is maintaining its freight operations during the lockdown, to transport essential goods.[33] On 29 March, Indian Railways announced that it would start service for special parcel trains to transport essential goods, in addition to regular freight service.[34] The national rail operator has also announced plans to convert coaches into isolation wards for patients of COVID-19.[35]\\nThe smaller railway viaduct near Thane in 1855\\nThe longer railway viaduct near Thane in 1855\\nRailway map of India in 1871\\nRailway map of India in 1909\",\n",

Jet Airways was the first airline in Southeast Asia to order the 737-800.[16] In the financial year 1996–97, the airline carried 2.4 million passengers and had a market share of 20 percent, second highest after state-owned Indian Airlines. By this time, the airline had a fleet of twelve Boeing 737 aircraft, operating 83 daily flights to 23 domestic destinations.[17] In 1997, the Cabinet Committee on Foreign Investment (CCFI) of the Government of India announced that foreign airlines would no longer be permitted to take an equity stake in joint ventures with Indian aviation companies, reversing the Government's earlier policy which had allowed carriers such as Gulf Air, Kuwait Airways and Lufthansa to hold a maximum 40% equity stake in their joint ventures with Indian partners.[18] In October 1997, as per this directive, Naresh Goyal took back control of Trade Winds from its foreign investors.[19][7]\\nAt the Paris Air Show in June 1999, Jet Airways announced an order worth approximately $550 million for ten Boeing 737-800 aircraft.[16] The airline purchased its first Boeing 737-400 simulator from CAE Inc. in 2001.[20] By April 2001, the airline fleet had grown to 30 aircraft and was operating over 195 flights daily to 37 destinations within India.[21] Jet Airways suffered losses for the first time since its establishment in financial year 2001–2002 as demand fell and costs increased.[22] Jet Airways was announced as launch customer for the Embraer 175 at the Farnborough air show in 2002,[23] with an order for ten aircraft and ten options[24] worth $520 million. But the deal was postponed due to the airline's financial difficulties and eventually fell through.[25] In 2003, the Indian government decided to allow private carriers to operate international services to countries in south Asia, such as Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.

Subsequent to introduction of the Banking Regulations Act, 1949 and Reserve Bank of India as the regulator for the banking sector, the bank obtained its banking license from RBI on 19 June 1958, and on 11 August 1958 it became a 'scheduled commercial bank' signifying capability to operate as a full-fledged commercial bank.[citation needed]\\nLakshmi Vilas Bank saw considerable expansion of its branch network during the period of 1961 to 1965, when the bank took over nine other banks. In 1974, the bank started expanding the branch network beyond Tamil Nadu to benefit from opportunities in the pan-Indian market. Thus, branches were established in the neighbouring states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala, important financial centres such as Mumbai, New Delhi and Kolkata as well as in other significant business centres in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Meanwhile, the bank attained the status of Authorized Dealer in foreign exchange in 1976 enabling it to provide full range of services to customers engaged in international trade and to overseas travellers. Mechanization was introduced in the Administrative Office as early as 1977, and data processing and computerization began in right earnest in 1993 by the bank's own in-house team.

       " \"Larsen & Toubro originated from a company founded in 1938 in Bombay by two Danish engineers, Henning Holck-Larsen and Søren Kristian Toubro. The company began as a representative of Danish manufacturers of dairy and allied equipment. However, with the start of the Second World War in 1939 and the resulting blockade of trade lines, the partners started a small workshop to undertake jobs and provide service facilities. Germany's invasion of Denmark in 1940 stopped supplies of Danish products. The war-time need to repair and refit and degauss ships offered L&T an opportunity, and led to the formation of a new company, Hilda Ltd, to handle these operations. L&T also started to repair and fabricate ships signalling the expansion of the company. The sudden internment of German engineers in British India (due to suspicions caused by the Second World War), who were to put up a soda ash plant for the Tata's, gave L&T a chance to enter the field of installation.[9]\\nIn 1944, ECC (Engineering Construction & Contracts) was incorporated by the partners; the company at this time was focused on construction projects (Presently, ECC is the construction division of L&T). L&T began several foreign collaborations. By 1945, the company represented British manufacturers of equipment used to manufacture products such as hydrogenated oils, biscuits, soaps and glass. In 1945, the company signed an agreement with Caterpillar Tractor Company, USA, for marketing earth moving equipment. At the end of the war, large numbers of war-surplus Caterpillar equipments were available at attractive prices, but the finances required were beyond the capacity of the partners. This prompted them to raise additional equity capital, and on 7 February 1946, Larsen & Toubro Private Limited was incorporated.[9]\\nAfter India's independence in 1947, the firm set up offices in Calcutta (now Kolkata), Madras (now Chennai) and New Delhi. In 1948, 55 acres of undeveloped marsh and jungle was acquired in Powai, Mumbai. In December 1950, L&T became a public company with a paid-up capital of ₹20 lakh (equivalent to ₹19 crore or US$2.5 million in 2020). The sales turnover in that year was ₹1.09 crore (equivalent to ₹102 crore or US$13 million in 2020). In 1956, a major part of the company's Mumbai office moved to ICI House in Ballard Estate, which would later be purchased by the company and renamed as L&T House, its present headquarters.[9]\\nDuring the 1960s, ventures included UTMAL (set up in 1960), Audco India Limited (1961), Eutectic Welding Alloys (1962) and TENGL (1963).[9]\\nIn 1965,the firm had been chosen as a partner for building nuclear reactors. Dr. Homi Bhabha, then chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) had in fact first approached L&T in the 1950s to fabricate critical components for atomic reactors. He convinced Holck-Larsen, a friend with whom he shared an interest in the arts that the company could do it, indeed must do it. L&T has since contributed significantly to the Indian nuclear programme ... Holck-Larsen was once asked by a junior engineer why L&T should get into building nuclear power plants when companies in the US and Germany were losing money on nuclear jobs.  He replied: 'Young man, India has to build nuclear power plants. If not L&T, who will do it?' [10]\\nDuring the 1970s, L&T was contracted to work with Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Its then chairman, Vikram Sarabhai, chose L&T as manufacturing partner. In 1972, when India launched its space programme, the firm was invited to participate.[11]\\nIn 1976, ECC bid for a large airport project in Abu Dhabi. ECC's balance sheet, however, did not meet the bid's financial qualification requirement. So it was merged into L&T. ECC was eventually rechristened L&T Construction and now accounts for the largest slice of the group's annual revenue.[12]\\nIn 1985, L&T entered into a partnership with Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). L&T was not yet allowed by the government to manufacture defence equipment but was permitted to participate in design and development programmes with DRDO. After the design and development was done,the firm had to hand over all the drawings to DRDO. The government would then assign the production work to a public sector defence unit or ordnance factory for manufacture. After a series of successes and positive policy initiatives, the firm today makes a range of weapon and missile systems, command and control systems, engineering systems and submarines through DRDO.[11]\",\n",

The company focused its product lines on non-perishable goods and organic cotton largely because spices, grains, and cotton were Indian specialties, and also because they required less intensive supply-chain management as compared to fresh produce. In order to meet global demand, Suminter integrated international organic certification into its operating model to create a \"farm to shelf\" fully integrated supply chain.\\nThough this added a 2–3 year gap between sourcing farms and organic procurement, Mehra eventually persuaded small-scale farmers of the long-term value of organic farming. Working with local NGOs, Suminter ensured consistent crop yields, safe farming practices, and a constant demand for produce. Moreover, the company passed on the benefit of higher organic margins, paying farmers a 10–20% premium over conventional products.[1][2]\\nSuminter has raised its first round of venture capital funding from Nexus India Capital in 2007.[4]\\nSuminter India Organics has been part of the Endeavor (non-profit) network since 2009.',\n",

Due to the erratic availability of power locally, and its rising costs, the highest business expenditure after the raw materials was electricity.[2] The cost of electricity also offset any profits made by the company.[3] After providing electricity for his own company, Tanti moved into wind energy production as a way to secure the textile company's energy needs, and founded Suzlon Energy.[4] Suzlon adopted a business model wherein clients would be responsible for 25% of the up-front capital investment and Suzlon would arrange the remaining 75% on loan. Initially, banks were hesitant to fund loans for this model, but by 2008, many Indian banks started financing wind power projects for Suzlon clients.[2]\\nIn 2001, Tanti sold off the textile business; Suzlon is still actively run by Tulsi Tanti, now in the role of Chairman, Suzlon Group.

EME had an option not to purchase the 150 turbines due to be delivered in 2009, which it has chosen to exercise.\\nIn November 2009, the company decided to sell 35% stake of Hansen for $370 million as part of its debt restructuring program, through placing new shares. It appointed Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley as the managers and book runners for the same.[7][8][9]\\nIn January 2011, Suzlon received an order worth US$1.28 billion for building 1000 megawatts of wind energy projects from the Indian branch of the Lord Swaraj Paul-owned Caparo Energy Ltd.[10]\\nIn May 2011, Suzlon announced returning to profitability after the financial crisis of 2009 [11]\\nIn October 2011, Suzlon sold its remaining 26.06% stake in Hansen Transmissions International NV to ZF Friedrichshafen AG for ₹8.9 billion (US$120 million).

Veeraraghavacharyar, a lecturer at Pachaiyappa\\'s College.[7] Started in order to support the campaign of Sir T. Muthuswamy Iyer for a judgeship at the Madras High Court and to counter the campaign against him carried out by the Anglo-Indian press, The Hindu was one of the newspapers of the period established to protest the policies of the British Raj. About 100 copies of the inaugural issue were printed at Srinidhi Press, Georgetown, on one rupee and twelve annas of borrowed money. Subramania Iyer became the first editor and Veera Raghavacharya, the first managing director of the newspaper.[citation needed]\\nThe paper was initially printed from Srinidhi Press but later moved to Scottish Press, then to The Hindu Press, Mylapore. Started as a weekly newspaper, the paper became a tri-weekly in 1883 and an evening daily in 1889. A single copy of the newspaper was priced at four annas. The offices moved to rented premises at 100 Mount Road on 3 December 1883. The newspaper started printing at its own press there, named \"The National Press,\" which was established on borrowed capital as public subscriptions were not forthcoming.

Later, Parthasarathy called N. Ram and other The Hindu employees “stalinists”, alleging that they were trying to oust her from the newspaper.[21][22]\\nIn 2011, during the resignation of N.

Three months later, in 1997, DBSS renamed itself to Cognizant Technology Solutions. In July 1997, Dun & Bradstreet bought Satyam\\'s 24% stake in DBSS for $3.4 million.[12][13] Headquarters were moved to the United States, and in March 1998, Kumar Mahadeva was named CEO.[14] Operating as a division of the Cognizant Corporation, the company focused on Y2K-related projects and web development.[15]\\nIn 1998, the parent company, Cognizant Corporation, split into two companies: IMS Health and Nielsen Media Research.[16] After this restructuring, Cognizant Technology Solutions became a public subsidiary of IMS Health. In June 1998, IMS Health partially spun off the company, conducting an initial public offering of the Cognizant stock. The company raised $34 million, less than what the IMS Health underwriters had hoped. They earmarked the money for debt payments and upgrading company offices.[15]\\nKumar Mahadeva decided to reduce the company\\'s dependence on Y2K projects: by Q1 1999, 26% of company\\'s revenues came from Y2K projects, compared with 49% in early 1998. Believing that the $16.6 billion enterprise resource planning software market was saturated, Kumar Mahadeva decided to refrain from large-scale ERP implementation projects. Instead, he focused on applications management, which accounted for 37% of Cognizant\\'s revenue in Q1 1999.[11] Cognizant\\'s revenues in 2002 were $229 million, and the company had zero debt with $100 million in the bank.[15] During the dotcom bust, the company grew by taking on the maintenance projects that larger IT services companies did not want.\\nCognizant\\'s old logo\\nCognizant\\'s logo until 2022 March from 2018\\nIn 2003, IMS Health sold its entire 56% stake in Cognizant, which instituted a poison pill provision to prevent hostile takeover attempts.[15][17] Kumar Mahadeva resigned as the CEO in 2003, and was replaced by Lakshmi Narayanan.[18] Gradually, the company\\'s services portfolio expanded across the IT services landscape and into business process outsourcing (BPO) and business consulting. Lakshmi Narayanan was succeeded by Francisco D\\'Souza in 2006. Cognizant experienced a period of fast growth during the 2000s, as reflected by its appearance in Fortune magazine\\'s \"100 Fastest-Growing Companies\" list for ten consecutive years from 2003 to 2012.[19][20]\\nIn September 2014, Cognizant struck its biggest deal, acquiring healthcare IT services provider TriZetto Corp for $2.7 billion.[21] Cognizant Shares, rose nearly 3 percent in pre-market trading.[22]\\nOn 24 June 2015, the company signed a multimillion-dollar agreement with Escorts Group in India to help Escorts\\' businesses in digital transformation and modernizing its operations across all business segments.[23]\\nOn 30 June 2015, it partnered with Singapore-based supermarket retailer NTUC FairPrice to perform digital transformation in NTUC\\'s business to improve personalized and consistent customer service across multiple channels.[24]\\nIn April 2018, Cognizant and a consortium of Indian life insurers announced their development of a blockchain solution aimed at increasing efficiency through facilitating cross-company data sharing.

       " 'Main article: History of IBM\\nIBM was founded in 1911 in Endicott, New York, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) and was renamed \"International Business Machines\" in 1924. IBM is incorporated in New York and has operations in over 170 countries.[6]\\nIn the 1880s, technologies emerged that would ultimately form the core of International Business Machines (IBM). Julius E. Pitrap patented the computing scale in 1885;[8] Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder (1888);[9] Herman Hollerith (1860–1929) patented the Electric Tabulating Machine;[10] and Willard Bundy invented a time clock to record a worker\\'s arrival and departure time on a paper tape in 1889.[11] On June 16, 1911, their four companies were amalgamated in New York State by Charles Ranlett Flint forming a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) based in Endicott, New York.[1][12] The five companies had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto.[citation needed]\\nThey manufactured machinery for sale and lease, ranging from commercial scales and industrial time recorders, meat and cheese slicers, to tabulators and punched cards. Thomas J. Watson, Sr., fired from the National Cash Register Company by John Henry Patterson, called on Flint and, in 1914, was offered a position at CTR.[13] Watson joined CTR as general manager then, 11 months later, was made President when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved.[14] Having learned Patterson\\'s pioneering business practices, Watson proceeded to put the stamp of NCR onto CTR\\'s companies.[15] He implemented sales conventions, \"generous sales incentives, a focus on customer service, an insistence on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen and had an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker\".[16][17] His favorite slogan, \"THINK\", became a mantra for each company\\'s employees.[16] During Watson\\'s first four years, revenues reached $9 million ($134 million today) and the company\\'s operations expanded to Europe, South America, Asia and Australia.[16] Watson never liked the clumsy hyphenated name \"Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company\" and on February 14, 1924, chose to replace it with the more expansive title \"International Business Machines\" which had previously been used as the name of CTR\\'s Canadian Division.[18] By 1933, most of the subsidiaries had been merged into one company, IBM.[19]\\nNACA researchers using an IBM type 704 electronic data processing machine in 1957\\nIBM has several leadership development and recognition programs to recognize employee potential and achievements. For early-career high potential employees, IBM sponsors leadership development programs by discipline (e.g., general management (GMLDP), human resources (HRLDP), finance (FLDP)). Each year, the company also selects 500 IBM employees for the IBM Corporate Service Corps (CSC),[20] which gives top employees a month to do humanitarian work abroad.[21] For certain interns, IBM also has a program called Extreme Blue that partners top business and technical students to develop high-value technology and compete to present their business case to the company\\'s CEO at internship\\'s end.[22]\\nThe company also has various designations for exceptional individual contributors such as Senior Technical Staff Member (STSM), Research Staff Member (RSM), Distinguished Engineer (DE), and Distinguished Designer (DD).[23] Prolific inventors can also achieve patent plateaus and earn the designation of Master Inventor. The company\\'s most prestigious designation is that of IBM Fellow. Since 1963, the company names a handful of Fellows each year based on technical achievement. Other programs recognize years of service such as the Quarter Century Club established in 1924, and sellers are eligible to join the Hundred Percent Club, composed of IBM salesmen who meet their quotas, convened in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Each year, the company also selects 1,000 IBM employees annually to award the Best of IBM Award, which includes an all-expenses-paid trip to the awards ceremony in an exotic location.\\nIBM\\'s culture has evolved significantly over its century of operations. In its early days, a dark (or gray) suit, white shirt, and a \"sincere\" tie constituted the public uniform for IBM employees.[24] During IBM\\'s management transformation in the 1990s, CEO Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. relaxed these codes, normalizing the dress and behavior of IBM employees.[25] The company\\'s culture has also given to different plays on the company\\'s acronym (IBM), with some saying it stands for \"I\\'ve Been Moved\" due to relocations and layoffs,[26] others saying it stands for \"I\\'m By Myself\" pursuant to a prevalent work-from-anywhere norm,[27] and others saying it stands for \"I\\'m Being Mentored\" due to the company\\'s open door policy and encouragement for mentoring at all levels.[28] In terms of labor relations, the company has traditionally resisted labor union organizing,[29] although unions represent some IBM workers outside the United States.[30] In Japan, IBM employees also have an American football team complete with pro stadium, cheerleaders and televised games, competing in the Japanese X-League as the \"Big Blue\".[31] IBM built the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, an electromechanical computer, during World War II. It offered its first commercial stored-program computer, the vacuum tube based IBM 701, in 1952. The IBM 305 RAMAC introduced the hard disk drive in 1956. The company switched to transistorized designs with the 7000 and 1400 series, beginning in 1958.\\nIn 1956, the company demonstrated the first practical example of artificial intelligence when Arthur L. Samuel of IBM\\'s Poughkeepsie, New York, laboratory programmed an IBM 704 not merely to play checkers but \"learn\" from its own experience. In 1957, the FORTRAN scientific programming language was developed. In 1961, IBM developed the SABRE reservation system for American Airlines and introduced the highly successful Selectric typewriter.\\nIn 1963, IBM employees and computers helped NASA track the orbital flights of the Mercury astronauts. A year later, it moved its corporate headquarters from New York City to Armonk, New York. The latter half of the 1960s saw IBM continue its support of space exploration, participating in the 1965 Gemini flights, 1966 Saturn flights, and 1969 lunar mission. IBM also developed and manufactured the Saturn V\\'s Instrument Unit and Apollo spacecraft guidance computers.\\nAn IBM System/360 in use at the University of Michigan c. 1969\\nIBM guidance computer hardware for the Saturn V Instrument Unit\\nOn April 7, 1964, IBM launched the first computer system family, the IBM System/360. It spanned the complete range of commercial and scientific applications from large to small, allowing companies for the first time to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their applications. It was followed by the IBM System/370 in 1970. Together the 360 and 370 made the IBM mainframe the dominant mainframe computer and the dominant computing platform in the industry throughout this period and into the early 1980s. They and the operating systems that ran on them such as OS/VS1 and MVS, and the middleware built on top of those such as the CICS transaction processing monitor, had a near-monopoly-level market share and became the thing IBM was most known for during this period.[32]\\nIn 1969, the United States of America alleged that IBM violated the Sherman Antitrust Act by monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the general-purpose electronic digital computer system market, specifically computers designed primarily for business, and subsequently alleged that IBM violated the antitrust laws in IBM\\'s actions directed against leasing companies and plug-compatible peripheral manufacturers. Shortly after, IBM unbundled its software and services in what many observers believed was a direct result of the lawsuit, creating a competitive market for software. In 1982 the Department of Justice dropped the case as \"without merit\".[33]\\nAlso in 1969, IBM engineer Forrest Parry invented the magnetic stripe card that would become ubiquitous for credit/debit/ATM cards, driver\\'s licenses, rapid transit cards, and a multitude of other identity and access control applications. IBM pioneered the manufacture of these cards, and for most of the 1970s, the data processing systems and software for such applications ran exclusively on IBM computers. In 1974, IBM engineer George J. Laurer developed the Universal Product Code.[34] IBM and the World Bank first introduced financial swaps to the public in 1981, when they entered into a swap agreement.[35] The IBM PC, originally designated IBM 5150, was introduced in 1981, and it soon became an industry standard. In 1991 IBM spun out its printer manufacturing into a new business called Lexmark.\\nIn 1993, IBM posted an $8 billion loss – at the time the biggest in American corporate history.[36] Lou Gerstner was hired as CEO from RJR Nabisco to turn the company around.[37] In 2002 IBM acquired PwC consulting.\\nIBM inventions: (clockwise from top-left) the hard-disk drive, DRAM, the UPC bar code, and the magnetic stripe card\\nIn 2005, the company sold its personal computer business to Chinese technology company Lenovo[38] and, in 2009, it acquired software company SPSS Inc. Later in 2009, IBM\\'s Blue Gene supercomputing program was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation by U.S. President Barack Obama. In 2011, IBM gained worldwide attention for its artificial intelligence program Watson, which was exhibited on Jeopardy! where it won against game-show champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. The company also celebrated its 100th anniversary in the same year on June 16. In 2012 IBM announced it has agreed to buy Kenexa and Texas Memory Systems,[39] and a year later it also acquired SoftLayer Technologies, a web hosting service, in a deal worth around $2 billion.[40] Also that year, the company designed a video surveillance system for Davao City.[41]\\nIn 2014, IBM announced it would sell its x86 server division to Lenovo for $2.1 billion.[42][better source needed] Also that year, IBM began announcing several major partnerships with other companies, including Apple Inc.,[43][44] Twitter,[45] Facebook,[46] Tencent,[47] Cisco,[48] UnderArmour,[49] Box,[50] Microsoft,[51] VMware,[52] CSC,[53] Macy\\'s,[54] Sesame Workshop,[55] the parent company of Sesame Street, and Salesforce.com.[56]\\nIn 2015, IBM announced three major acquisitions: Merge Healthcare for $1 billion,[57] data storage vendor Cleversafe, and all digital assets from The Weather Company, including Weather.com and the Weather Channel mobile app.[58][59] Also that year, IBM employees created the film A Boy and His Atom, which was the first molecule movie to tell a story. In 2016, IBM acquired video conferencing service Ustream and formed a new cloud video unit.[60][61] In April 2016, it posted a 14-year low in quarterly sales.[62] The following month, Groupon sued IBM accusing it of patent infringement, two months after IBM accused Groupon of patent infringement in a separate lawsuit.[63]\\nIn 2015, IBM bought the digital part of The Weather Company;,[64] Truven Health Analytics for $2.6 billion in 2016, and in October 2018, IBM announced its intention to acquire Red Hat for $34 billion,[65][66][67] which was completed on July 9, 2019.[68]\\nIBM announced in October 2020 that it would divest the Managed Infrastructure Services unit of its Global Technology Services division into a new public company.[69] The new company, Kyndryl, will have 90,000 employees, 4,600 clients in 115 countries, with a backlog of $60 billion.[70][71][72] IBM\\'s spin off will be greater than any of its previous divestitures, and welcomed by investors.[73][74][75] In January 2021, IBM appointed Martin Schroeter, who had been IBM\\'s CFO from 2014 through the end of 2017, as CEO of Kyndryl.[76][77]\\nIBM has regularly sold off low margin assets while shifting its focus to higher-value, more profitable markets. Examples include:\\n1991: Spun off its printer and keyboard manufacturing division, the IBM Information Products Corporation, to Lexmark\\n2002–2020: Acquired PwC Consulting (2002), SPSS (2009), The Weather Company (2016), Red Hat (2019), and European cloud consultant Nordcloud (2020)[78]\\n2005 and 2014, respectively: Sold its personal computer (ThinkPad/ThinkCentre) and x86-based server businesses to Lenovo\\n2015: IBM adopted a \"fabless\" model with semiconductors design, while offloading manufacturing to GlobalFoundries\\n2021: IBM spun-off its managed infrastructure services unit into a new public company named Kyndryl.[79][80] IBM also announced the acquisition of the enterprise software company Turbonomic for $1.5 Billion.[81]\\n2022: IBM announced that it would sell Watson Health to the private equity firm Francisco Partners.[82]',\n",

Licences for these circles had initially been awarded by the DoT in 1994, 1997 and 1995 respectively. Between 1992 and 2006, Hutchison acquired interests in all 23 mobile telecom circles of India.[5]\\nHMTL was renamed Hutchison Essar Limited (HEL) in August 2005.[7] In Delhi, Uttar Pradesh (East), Rajasthan and Haryana, Essar Group was the major partner. But later Hutch took the majority stake. By the time of Hutchison Telecom\\'s initial public offering in 2004, Hutchison Whampoa had acquired interests in six mobile telecommunications operators providing service in 13 of India\\'s 23 licence areas and following the completion of the acquisition of BPL Mobile that number increased to 16. In 2006, it announced the acquisition of a company (Essar Spacetel — A subsidiary of Essar Group) that held licence applications for the seven remaining licence areas. Initially, the company grew its business in the largest wireless markets in India — in cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata. In these densely populated urban areas it was able to establish a robust network, well-known brand and large distribution network – all vital to long-term success in India. Then it also targeted business users and high-end post-paid customers which helped Hutchison Essar to consistently generate a higher Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) than its competitors. By adopting this focused growth plan, it was able to establish leading positions in India\\'s largest markets providing the resources to expand its footprint nationwide. In February 2007, Hutchison Telecom announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with a subsidiary of Vodafone Group Plc to sell its 67% direct and indirect equity and loan interests in Hutchison Essar Limited for a total cash consideration (before costs, expenses and interests) of approximately $11.1 billion. The Acquisition was completed on May 8, 2007.[citation needed]\\nHutch was often praised for its award-winning advertisements which all follow a clean, minimalist look. A recurrent theme is that its message \"Hi\" stands out visibly though it uses only white letters on red background. Another successful ad campaign in 2003 featured a pug named Cheeka following a boy around in unlikely places, with the tagline, \"Wherever you go, our network follows.\" The simple yet powerful advertisement campaigns won it many admirers. Advertisements featuring the pug were continued by Vodafone even after rebranding. The brand subsequently introduced ZooZoos which gained even higher popularity than was created by the Pug. Vodafone\\'s creative agency is O&M while Harit Nagpal was the Marketing Director during the various phases of its brand evolution.[citation needed]',\n",

       " \"Larsen & Toubro originated from a company founded in 1938 in Bombay by two Danish engineers, Henning Holck-Larsen and Søren Kristian Toubro. The company began as a representative of Danish manufacturers of dairy and allied equipment. However, with the start of the Second World War in 1939 and the resulting blockade of trade lines, the partners started a small workshop to undertake jobs and provide service facilities. Germany's invasion of Denmark in 1940 stopped supplies of Danish products. The war-time need to repair and refit and degauss ships offered L&T an opportunity, and led to the formation of a new company, Hilda Ltd, to handle these operations. L&T also started to repair and fabricate ships signalling the expansion of the company. The sudden internment of German engineers in British India (due to suspicions caused by the Second World War), who were to put up a soda ash plant for the Tata's, gave L&T a chance to enter the field of installation.[9]\\nIn 1944, ECC (Engineering Construction & Contracts) was incorporated by the partners; the company at this time was focused on construction projects (Presently, ECC is the construction division of L&T). L&T began several foreign collaborations. By 1945, the company represented British manufacturers of equipment used to manufacture products such as hydrogenated oils, biscuits, soaps and glass. In 1945, the company signed an agreement with Caterpillar Tractor Company, USA, for marketing earth moving equipment. At the end of the war, large numbers of war-surplus Caterpillar equipments were available at attractive prices, but the finances required were beyond the capacity of the partners. This prompted them to raise additional equity capital, and on 7 February 1946, Larsen & Toubro Private Limited was incorporated.[9]\\nAfter India's independence in 1947, the firm set up offices in Calcutta (now Kolkata), Madras (now Chennai) and New Delhi. In 1948, 55 acres of undeveloped marsh and jungle was acquired in Powai, Mumbai. In December 1950, L&T became a public company with a paid-up capital of ₹20 lakh (equivalent to ₹19 crore or US$2.5 million in 2020). The sales turnover in that year was ₹1.09 crore (equivalent to ₹102 crore or US$13 million in 2020). In 1956, a major part of the company's Mumbai office moved to ICI House in Ballard Estate, which would later be purchased by the company and renamed as L&T House, its present headquarters.[9]\\nDuring the 1960s, ventures included UTMAL (set up in 1960), Audco India Limited (1961), Eutectic Welding Alloys (1962) and TENGL (1963).[9]\\nIn 1965,the firm had been chosen as a partner for building nuclear reactors. Dr. Homi Bhabha, then chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) had in fact first approached L&T in the 1950s to fabricate critical components for atomic reactors. He convinced Holck-Larsen, a friend with whom he shared an interest in the arts that the company could do it, indeed must do it. L&T has since contributed significantly to the Indian nuclear programme ... Holck-Larsen was once asked by a junior engineer why L&T should get into building nuclear power plants when companies in the US and Germany were losing money on nuclear jobs.  He replied: 'Young man, India has to build nuclear power plants. If not L&T, who will do it?' [10]\\nDuring the 1970s, L&T was contracted to work with Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Its then chairman, Vikram Sarabhai, chose L&T as manufacturing partner. In 1972, when India launched its space programme, the firm was invited to participate.[11]\\nIn 1976, ECC bid for a large airport project in Abu Dhabi. ECC's balance sheet, however, did not meet the bid's financial qualification requirement. So it was merged into L&T. ECC was eventually rechristened L&T Construction and now accounts for the largest slice of the group's annual revenue.[12]\\nIn 1985, L&T entered into a partnership with Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). L&T was not yet allowed by the government to manufacture defence equipment but was permitted to participate in design and development programmes with DRDO. After the design and development was done,the firm had to hand over all the drawings to DRDO. The government would then assign the production work to a public sector defence unit or ordnance factory for manufacture. After a series of successes and positive policy initiatives, the firm today makes a range of weapon and missile systems, command and control systems, engineering systems and submarines through DRDO.[11]\",\n",
